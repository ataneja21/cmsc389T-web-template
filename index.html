                <p>Hi! My name is Annaika and I am junior Computer Science major at the University of Maryland!</p>
                <p>Here are some professional details about my life: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I never considered pursuing computer science in college until I took the introductory class (CMSC131) on a whim, and now I've never looked back!</li>
                    <li>Last summer, I interned as an Embedded Engineering Intern at Qualcomm, which was super cool! These are some of the things I did: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Worked on the display screen of an Android device, and tested it to detect any corruption that happens to the screen! (Basically found ways to detect if people hack your device/screen)</li>
                        <li>Learned how to surf because of intern surfing lessons!! And also learned that I am a very bad surfer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>I also help to organize Technica, which is a hackathon for underrepresented genders here at UMD! </li>
                    <li>In the past, I've taught coding to girls through a program called Kode with Klossy, and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had!! It inspired me to teach more and become a TA here at UMD!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>And here are some cool personal details: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I'm a very big fan of learning different languages, especially French! I have a B1 level of proficency in French (based on the CEFR exam) and I'm also a French minor!</li>
                    <li>I've been to 12 different countries but the most beautiful place I've ever visited has been Meteora, Greece! I'd love to go there again.</li>
                    <li>My biggest dream is to sing at a jazz club one day. Maybe one day it'll happen!</li>
                </ol>

                    <h2>Internship at Qualcomm</h2>
                    <p>In Summer 2023, I was an Embedded Engineering Intern at Qualcomm! This was an amazing experience! I got to work on the Android Display Team and test to see if the display was corrupted or not.</p>
                    <p>Here are some more technical details about that: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I helped detect corruption to the screen during a "Trusted UI Session" or during a time where you have something very sensitive/personal on your phone, such as when you're looking at your bank account. </li>
                        <li>I tested on devices with one and two screens, so I helped run tests for the Samsung Galaxy Fold, which has two screens!</li>
                        <li>I worked in C++ and ran CRCs (Cyclic Redundancy Checks) to help write my tests! </li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="column reveal" style="background-color:#BFB5B9;">
                    <h2>Technica!</h2>
                    <p>For the past two years, I've helped to organize Technica, a hackathon here at UMD! In particular, I've worked on the sponsorship team, helping to contact many companies and ask if they want to sponsor the event.</p>
                    <p>It has been a crazy amount of work, but also super rewarding! I was able to raise $270,000 of sponsorships in 2022, and this past year in a tougher economic market I was able to raise $160,000!!</p>

                    <h2>QUEST Press!</h2>
                    <p>I'm part of an honors program here called the QUEST Honors Program. As a part of it, I've been able to interview the members and write articles about different events that have happened in the program!</p>
