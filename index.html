<p>
Hi! I am a computer science major at the University of Maryland and I hail from East Brunswick, New Jersey! At UMD, I am a part of the Scholar's Program in Science, Discovery, and the Universe, the QUEST Honors Program, and Technica! 
</p>
<p>
My passion for code started after I took a class in R over quarantine and a web development course that I took this summer. Both classes made me realize how much I like coding. At UMD, I hope to explore my interests in engineering and computer science through my classes as well as several engineering clubs! 
</p>
<p>
Outside of school, I hope to study many languages and go on a study abroad some day (I would first love to learn Spanish, but I do harbor a secret desire to learn Turkish as well)!
